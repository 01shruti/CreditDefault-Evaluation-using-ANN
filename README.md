Artificial neural network is an information processing system which is
influenced by the human brain and works on the same principles of the
biological nervous system. They possess the ability to extract meaning
from complex and intricate data, by detecting trends and extracting pat-
terns from it. This paper illustrates the ability of neural network model
and linear regression model constructed to predict the creditworthiness
of an application accurately and precisely with minimal false predictions
and errors. The results are shown to be similar for both the models, thus,
models are efficient to use depending on the type of application and at-
tributes.
